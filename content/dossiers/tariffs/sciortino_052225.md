The failures of the Democratic administration can be
seen not as contingent errors, but rather as the tail end of a long
cycle of U.S. and global politics &mdash; namely, that of ascendent
globalisation, which had already been severely shaken by the crisis of
2008.

retribution for the policies pursued globally for decades by the U.S.
foreign policy community. While at first glance only chaos seems to
reign, the challenge lies in identifying a fundamental *logic* within
this chaos. Put another way, Trump is both a symptom and a product of
profound material impulses, internal as well as external. More than
this, he is the actor attempting to change the United States' strategic
posture on the world stage &mdash; placing it on a new course and with
outcomes that remain uncertain and difficult to predict.
<br />
<br />
In an immediate sense, Trump 2.0 is the product of three primary and
tangible failures of the Biden administration: 1) its failure to inflict
a "strategic defeat" upon Russia in the Ukrainian conflict, prompting
instead Moscow's further rapprochement with China and a large part of
the global South; 2) its failure to achieve a selective decoupling from
China, by blocking the latter's technological modernisation and ascent
in global value chains; 3) its failure to stem the deterioration of the
domestic social context (despite its commitment to a "middle class
foreign policy" and gestures toward reshoring, which in reality went no
further than the beginnings of friendshoring with countries such as
Mexico and Vietnam). In light of these failures alone, it is more than
reasonable to suggest that it was Biden (whose measures, after all, were
enacted in the protectionist wake of Trump 1.0) who has proved to be the
parenthesis here. 
<br />
<br />
More than this, the failures of the Democratic administration can be
seen not as contingent errors, but rather as the tail end of a long
cycle of U.S. and global politics &mdash; namely, that of ascendent
globalisation, which had already been severely shaken by the crisis of
2008. Today that cycle is coming to an end, having made the United
States more dependent on a world that it continues to *dominate*, albeit
with evermore serious economic costs (relative deindustrialisation and
an unending trade deficit), with growing social polarisation and
disintegration, and with the no-longer hypothetical risk that China may
yet escape the still-prevailing [imperialist mechanism of the dollar's
withdrawal.](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2577-the-us-china-rift-and-its-impact-on-globalisation)[^1]
These are the deep and underlying causes of the increasingly evident
"regulatory crisis" of the international system (of *Pax Americana*),
the dialectical inversion of the domination wielded by what is in the
strict sense the only imperialist power remaining on the scene &mdash; one
capable of combining foreign investments abroad, world monetary
seigniorage, global control of land, sea and space through full-spectrum
military power, with a state apparatus that is extensively projected
overseas.
<br />
<br />
Within the United States, the reaction to these failures was propelled
by pressures coming from the depths of society intersecting with those
stemming from important fractions of U.S. capitalism. The latter are
those fractions that to date have been least favoured by global
projection (the industrial sectors of "old" technology such as the oil
industry), or a new generation of up-and-coming military industrial
firms linked more closely to the tech industry (Palantir, SpaceX, etc.)
and at odds with some large financial concerns. Nonetheless, it would be
inadequate to look no further than this. The impulse from below,
reaching well beyond the MAGA movement, is also a determinant factor in
the change currently underway: a pressure that is undoubtedly an
inter-class one (in particular, downwardly-mobile middle classes), but
that also expresses social demands from important sectors of the (not
only "white") proletariat, who are less and less inclined to endure the
[negative repercussions of
globalisation](https://projectpppr.org/populisms/blog-post-title-one-jzade).[^2]
This Trumpist assemblage is not yet a homogenous social bloc, and might
never become one. For now, however, it channels proletarian expectations
of defensive economic nationalism that &mdash; like it or not &mdash; fills the void
left by the ghost of New Deal reformism.
<br />
<br />
Trump is the response to all this &mdash; in a situation that in some ways
recalls Nixon's first term &mdash; through a strategy of reversing the Volcker
shock of the early 1980s (the effective trigger of so-called financial
globalisation driven by the dollar and the U.S. fiscal and current
account deficits, paid for by the issuance of mountains of Treasury
bonds). The nucleus of Trump's team, which is tighter than eight years
ago, is clearly focused on the risk of U.S. decline, the need for a
medium-to-long-term perspective able to accept sacrifices and returns
that are not immediate ones, and the existential stakes of maintaining
United States world supremacy. Going further, some of MAGA's leading
exponents betray the sense of a broad-spectrum "crisis of (Western)
civilisation" that extends well beyond a purely economic or geopolitical
reading of America's crisis.
<br />
<br />
For now, between the ups and downs of pronouncements and measures,
what's clear is a forcing from above that corresponds to the radical
nature of the change envisaged. The strategy that is being laid out (at
least in a provisional way, and with due caution) is that of "one step
back, two steps forward". *One step back* on the [diplomatic-military
plane](https://www.newstatesman.com/ns-interview/2024/07/elbridge-colby-i-am-signalling-to-china-that-my-policy-is-status-quo)
aimed at trying to avoid triggering a direct military confrontation with
Russia and China (hence the search for an exit strategy from
Ukraine &mdash; even better if this means a quasi-rapprochement with
Russia &mdash; and efforts to ease tensions with Tehran), compensated by
"reasonable diversions" (Panama, Greenland, etc.).[^3] For Washington,
this involves taking a breather by acknowledging its present inability
to wage war upon two enemies, as has been made clear by the Ukraine
conflict &mdash; and here Trump has the support of important forces within the
Pentagon. *Two steps forward* in terms of coercive economic diplomacy
through zero-sum negotiations supported by tariff measures brandished
like a big stick, by the devaluation of the dollar, and by the
restructuring of foreign debt imposed on allies in exchange for military
"protection" ([as outlined by Trump's economic advisor Stephen
Miran](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf)).
<br />
<br />
All this with the goal of relaunching domestic industrial production in
strategic sectors in light of future major wars, under the guise of a
"productivist" (rather than welfarist) defense of labour. Looking ahead
in perspective, there are indications of a complete decoupling from
China in the medium to long term, paid for by allies and friends
financially (through hundred-year Treasury bonds), militarily (through
increased purchases of U.S. weapons) and on the energy front (through
the purchase of high-cost natural gas). Decoupling from China is seen by
Trump's entourage as the only effective means of blocking or derailing
the PRC's economic growth and social-political stability. The exorbitant
tariffs imposed &mdash; and then partly suspended &mdash; in April are the first
step, therefore, in differentiated negotiations with Beijing on the one
hand, and the E.U. and friendly East Asian countries on the other. But
even for the latter, the dismantling of part of their industry will
become a necessary (if not sufficient) condition for the reconstruction
of the U.S. industrial apparatus: a dismantling that will be partially
compensated by selective friendshoring for some supply chains &mdash; even if
these will be increasingly dependent on the U.S. sitting at the top of
these chains, and with \"Chinese\" conditions for the workers involved.
In other words, all of this envisages a reconfiguration of US Grand
Strategy for a [post-globalisation international
order](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2024/11/america-china-and-the-death-of-the-international-monetary-non-system/),
which will leave plenty of dead and wounded in its wake.[^4]
<br />
<br />
It would be naive to think that these medium- and long-term objectives
can be easily obtained thanks to the dollar's leverage &mdash; which remains
irreplaceable on international markets &mdash; along with the size of the U.S.
domestic market. But it would also be naive to exclude *a priori* the
feasibility of such a strategy by appealing to a U.S. decline understood
in naturalistic terms (many leftists already predicted this incorrectly
back in the 1970s). Certainly, Trump faces considerable obstacles.
Domestically, there is a hostile state apparatus and foreign policy
community (still able to spike his guns, as with Ukraine); the compact
between the Federal Reserve and Wall Street (which has already thrown
its weight around with Treasury bond yields); the negative repercussions
for Trump's social base should there be a recession, which would
energise those social sectors that have benefited most from
globalisation (the urban professionals and middle class in digital and
financial services, the world of media and tertiary education).
Internationally: an undaunted China that for some time now has been
restructuring its development model away from dependence on exports; the
rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing, which by this stage will be
difficult to break; the multi-alignment of the BRICS countries; the
uncertainty of Germany's repositioning. Moreover, the situation in the
Middle East could get out of hand in the face of Israeli ambitions that
could drag the U.S. into a war with Iran, while negotiating an end to
the Ukrainian conflict continues to appear far from easy. Put simply,
given the unreliability of U.S. power, anti-American resentment can only
be expected to grow, even in "friendly" countries.
<br />
<br />
But behind all this, the fundamental issue is the objective difficulty
of grafting a neo-mercantilist logic (centred on the export of
commodities) within an imperialist economic-social structure based on
direct foreign investments and on the dollar as the de facto world
currency that grants control over international capital flows, albeit at
the cost of a growing trade deficit. This structure, which emerged
following the end of the Bretton Woods international monetary system in
1971, has been incredibly successful for the U.S. in terms of
disintegrating the state and financial barriers of other states (in
particular those of its allies, less so with China and Russia). Today,
however, it risks disintegrating the U.S.' very industrial and social
structure, which now discovers &mdash; as its main competitor &mdash; its own
currency, considering the dollar's overvaluation and the FDI-induced
de-industrialization!
<br />
<br />
In this way, the boomerang of imperialism returns to its centre, on a
scale unprecedented within the historical parabola of capitalist
imperialism. This also explains the surprising return of an
unprecedented "national question" within the West, in the form of
populisms and sovereignisms that are gaining momentum among the
impoverished middle strata and proletarians seeking protections that the
old workers' movement can no longer provide. Thus, the coexistence
within proletarian sectors of (above all anti-Chinese) chauvinism and
"neo-reformist" (especially anti-finance) demands &mdash; an ambivalence that
the future will have to resolve.
<br />
<br />
If it's difficult to predict how things will evolve, we can more or less
imagine two counterposed scenarios. In the first, as a result of the
obstacles identified so far, Trump's efforts will end in chaos &mdash; with
consequences as yet unforeseen, but certainly of great importance for
the international order's already precarious stability. In the second,
the success of the new U.S. strategy will lead to the formation of two
opposed blocs: the first led by the United States, with a submissive
Europe[^5], reduced to a sort of backyard (not unlike Latin America);
the other around a China allied with Moscow, and more integrated with
the East Asian economy. Even here, the unknowns will prove important, if
only in a minor key, for the stability of dollarisation: what will
Germany, Japan, South Korea, India, Turkey do? Both scenarios, through
different paths, spell the end of globalisation as we know it, fostering
a return to the control of capital and currencies (by strong state
entities), and the multi-domestic reconfiguration of multinational
companies. Rather than the beginning of a relatively stable multipolar
international order, this would be a highly conflictual one, given the
United States' more or less accelerated preparation for war against
China, with a clampdown on Washington's allies and friends &mdash; something
that we can see is already well underway.
<br />
<br />
In all this, the most interesting element is the return of a deep social
crisis at the heart of Western imperialism, a return that foreshadows
the possible reactivation of a passive, dispersed and fragmented
proletariat. If we are looking for some necessary condition that could
reopen the game on the level of class relations, through a possible
resumption of class conflicts on a global scale, this would seem to lie
in growing difficulties &mdash; both economic and geopolitical, including
possible military defeats &mdash; facing the imperialist system's "strong
link" (as Lenin might put it). With a systemic crisis of social
reproduction on the horizon, will U.S.-centered imperialism be able to
"unite the separated" (as Debord might put it)[^6] yet again?
