reviewing the ledger of global catastrophe. Chaos, crisis,
destabilization &mdash; it's hard to even find the words adequate to express
the architectonic character of the compensations: planetary reprisals
meted out in familiar forms, but with unpredictable tempos and a strange
virulence. *Strange* is perhaps the best we can do for now. The
tragedy-farce of this historical train wreck is nothing if not uncanny.
There are no parables that satisfy these moments, when the wreckage
piles in heaps and clumps, a cruel edifice of defeats, writhing like an
eldritch abomination roused from ancient slumber, animated through the
intercourse of the species, yet entirely indifferent to it. \
\
Like all years now, 2025 began with fire. There was of course the
sequence of wildfires that struck southern California, the most
destructive to date, and the most expensive natural disaster in United
States history. The long century of fire mismanagement-by-suppression
has so clearly come undone that, by now, it would be an aberration for a
single year to pass without some record-breaking wildfires devouring
unfathomable swaths of land at astonishing paces. Ignition is
practically guaranteed: the world is too hot, water too scarce,
infrastructure too neglected, tinder too ubiquitous. Fire in these
regions has always been a statistical certainty, as the late Mike Davis
put it.[^2] Now we can say the same of the annual, record-breaking
catastrophe itself. All that is left to be decided are the patterns of
abandonment apportioned by the administrators of property, which
predictably crystallize along lines of class, race and nation. While the
uber-wealthy of the Palisades shelled out daily thousands on private
firefighting crews to secure their assets, elsewhere California deployed
800 incarcerated workers, working for dollars a day, on multiple fronts
to contain the half-dozen winter blazes. Meanwhile, the residents of
majority non-white Altadena, historically a bulwark of black
homeownership, were served delayed evacuation orders, with the Eaton
fire subsequently destroying over 10,000 structures and claiming at
least 17 deaths at the time of this writing. Almost half of the
Altadena's black households were destroyed or damaged. In the
disintegrating ecology of the planetary factory, catastrophes assume
definite forms as distinct "species of conflagration," to borrow again
from Davis. The phylogeny of capitalist reproduction ensures the uneven
development of the apocalypse. \

Other fires on other shores have proven no less devastating. Ukraine has seen its military front recede as Russian advancements have recovered territory in the east. While the impasse brought Zelenskyy to the negotiating table, weeks of ceasefire talks have been fraught with tension and posturing, to say the least. With the European project facing such dim prospects, the Trump administration has suggested coupling U.S. aid packages and security with privileged access to Ukraine’s rare-earth minerals, along with its oil and natural gas reserves—crucial for any revival of manufacturing as part of Trump’s promised industrial policies—to be controlled through a joint investment fund. The Sudanese Civil War rages on, drawing belligerents from competing commodity chains, extractive hinterlands, and rural surplus populations. Beset by widespread famine and millions of internally-displaced refugees, the situation is the largest crisis of its kind in the world. And after fifteen months of genocidal wreckage, with at least 50,000 dead and over 100,000 missing, Israel finally and begrudgingly agreed to an armistice and prisoner exchange with Hamas. A return to colonial hostilities seemed all but assured during the brief détente, as Israel flouted the terms of the agreement, continuing to shoot Gazans, interfere with aid shipments, cut off electricity and escalate its incursions into the West Bank, recovering whatever political legitimacy it could among its fanatical settler constituency. After just two months, the fragile ceasefire collapsed under a cascade of missiles and heavy artillery officially dubbed “Operation Might and Sword.” In a single day, the death toll rose by some 400 Palestinians, the majority women and children—one of the deadliest days since the Al-Aqsa Flood. As of this writing, hundreds more have died, over a thousand seriously injured, and over 140,000 displaced, as the IDF resumes ground operations and forced evacuations. In response to Israel’s continuous disruption of humanitarian aid during the ceasefire, Houthis executed over 190 attacks on shipping traffic in the Red Sea. The U.S. responded by hitting Yemen with dozens of airstrikes. Not to be outdone, Israel resumed bombing Lebanon, claiming Hezbollah violated its November 2024 ceasefire agreement.  Meanwhile, Trump continues to threaten Gazans with yet another kind of F.I.R.E.: real estate development. \
\
If Palestine is a barometer for liberatory prospects more generally, it
is telling that the Gaza War should be the most significant conflict
since 1973, when the Fourth Arab-Israeli War provided the threshold
beyond which the global structure of capitalism would be irreparably
altered. Forced into a detente by Arab states, Israel began officially
pursuing the "peace process," its utter failure casting a long shadow
over the subsequent half century. After decades of warfare mediated by
state actors, Palestinian resistance began to take on a more distributed
and insurgent quality, characteristic of the civilian-led Intifadas.
After the U.S. began supporting Israel in that war, OPEC prosecuted its
now-infamous embargo in the first "oil shock" of the 1970s, initiating a
sequence of energy crises that accelerated the unraveling of U.S.-led
global production. \
\
It feels that we are caught between 1973 and 2025, between collapsing
heavens and the unyielding earth below. Like a dying god, capital can
barely retain the human flesh that animates it. Meanwhile, promises to
resurrect the labor movement reveal themselves as empty acts of
necromancy. The blighted accretions of capitalist growth are little more
than idle monuments to dead generations. The social peace has come
undone. So scarce today are prospects for a return on investments that
value chains penetrate the deepest hollows of the earth, leveling and
reorganizing its surface, probing for the cheapest inputs, and
disrupting the entire biogeochemical metabolism. In tottering, lumbering
motion, the planetary factory extends its frail limbs, scours and
abrades crust, water, and ice, with fire always soon to follow.
Capitalism is the name for this perverted metabolism, imperialism its
architecture. Metabolic recompense takes the form of floods and fires,
swarms and plagues, species of conflagration witnessed in ever greater
frequency. \
\
The depravity of the situation should by now be clear. After a decade of
ebbs and flows, the wave of struggles initiated after the collapse of
the global financial system appears now in retrospect to have crested
during the long 2020. Following a series of decisive global defeats for
ersatz-social democracy, with the liberal center only barely able to
stave off a resurgent far-right by prosecuting a campaign against the
left, mass politics once again assumed more insurgent forms: Iran,
France, Haiti, Mexico, Sudan, Algeria, Hong Kong, Chile, Puerto Rico, Lebanon,
Iraq, Nigeria, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka &mdash; the list goes on.
2018-2022 witnessed a sequence of historical uprisings both preceding
and following the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, the George
Floyd Rebellion became perhaps the largest and most destructive in U.S.
history, torching and leveling numerous buildings and expropriating
countless businesses &mdash; a general siege on the regime of property and the
police that enforce it. In Canada, a cascade of port and rail blockades
executed in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en land defenders throttled the
arteries of global commodity flows, just weeks before the pandemic would
generalize the effect across the planet. \
\
COVID-19 picked at the scab of "economic recovery." A decade of sluggish
growth, stagnant wages, and asset inflation, braced by an addiction to
quantitative easing, was by 2019 showing clear signs of strain. The
pandemic offered momentary relief to this senescent juggernaut,
providing an exogenous explanation for the recession and unemployment.
But covid did more than rip off the scab of this festering wound; it
brought contradictions long-submerged to the surface. Inflation returned
in a force not seen since the 1970s. It turns out that we've long been
living in an era of inflation in the form of what Paul Mattick calls
"competition by price maintenance," a historical expression of the
growing insufficiency of the total social profit.[^3] The decades-long
interlude of suppressed inflation and low interest rates, from the 1980s
to a few years ago, had been underwritten by the historical integration
of massive segments of the global population into the circuits of
capital &mdash; the former USSR and Eastern Bloc, decolonizing countries, and
above all China &mdash; which allowed producers to maintain low costs and stem
inflationary pressures. This temporary fix cannot be repeated. Now those
same regions face declining growth, and the prospects for new industrial
territories are few and fleeting. Inflation has returned to the
historical stage, given its first push by the pandemic rupture of the
global supply chain, then a big shove by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Despite persistently maintaining elevated interest rates, central banks
have not been able to turn the tide. \
 \
This has left governments little choice but to induce recession, thus
curbing investment, or else be forced to deal with an increasingly
restive populace who can no longer afford basic goods. Neither option
can address the structural causes of inflation. Since early 2022, we
have been caught in a holding pattern of inflation struggles over the
price of inputs and consumer goods, oscillating between the food riots
of Sri Lanka, Iraq, Sudan, Ecuador or Peru, on the one hand, and the
farmers' protests that have spread across the European Union, Latin
America, and India on the other. If anything unites these struggles it
is the mere inability to survive the post-pandemic order, with prices
impairing the social reproduction of different fragments of the class in
different ways &mdash; too high for some, too low for others. Unfortunately,
these conflicts tend to become unified only in the national body, given
the function of central banks to maintain prices at the national level.
It's no surprise, then, that a retrenched right-wing populism and
economic nationalism have only gained momentum in recent years,
witnessed in the wave of far-right victories in parliamentary elections
and, of course, the bitter re-coronation of Donald Trump. \
\
The abject failures of Biden's industrial policy, the punditry's
much-touted "Bidenomics," can be understood only in this dim flickering
light of global economic decline. The centrist rhetorical embrace of
"supply-side economics" was made politically feasible by a year of riots
and pandemic, to be sure. But it was really the shakeout provided by
Trump's earlier program of economic nationalism that put the zero-sum
game of contemporary industrial policy back on the agenda. It was Trump
who threw the first stones at China in the name of making U.S.
manufacturing more competitive. It was the early pandemic relief
packages (primarily aimed at floundering businesses) that provided proof
of concept for the fiscal policies and the role of central banks in
maintaining liquidity, both long advocated by the neo-Keynesians who
congregated around Biden. The economic continuity between Trump and
Biden was obscured by dressing the latter in green garb, championed as
historic by the usual suspects on the social democratic left. Together,
the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act (designed to raise U.S. industrial
competitiveness by spending more on infrastructure and education, and by
providing tax breaks for onshore manufacturing and renewable energy
investment) accomplished precious little beyond rebranding the trade war
into a sort of progressive gesture. In the handoff, Biden's technocrats
did not foresee the looming threat of inflation that would so quickly
dash their hopes and dreams of  "modern American industrial
strategy." All the familiar macroeconomic indicators &mdash; investment in
plant and equipment, productivity growth, employment growth &mdash; have
remained stagnant. Perhaps the only meaningful accomplishment of
Bidenomics was achieving record-breaking oil and gas production under
the guise of "Green Industrial Policy." \
\
No wonder, then, that Trump would ride back into office primarily as a
result of low voter turnout. Having received approximately the same
number of votes as in the 2020 election, Trump gained little new support
or appeal. 2024 was, if anything, a referendum on the failures of the
Democratic Party &mdash; yet another final nail in the coffin of American
liberalism. Of course, prospects under Trump fair no better. Industrial
policy today cannot conjure the return of economic growth, at least not
in the absence of full-scale global war and widespread destruction of
plant and equipment. While these are no doubt possibilities, they do not
present a clear path forward for any government. Threats to seize the
Panama Canal or expand U.S. sovereignty over Greenland seem more
bombastic than imminent. Control over trade routes and extractive
reserves &mdash; especially as climate change opens the arctic as a strategic
corridor for both &mdash; are certainly matters of significance in the
zero-sum imperial drama, but breathing life into expansionist rhetoric
also contradicts Trump's stated aim of reducing military spending and
negotiating arms control. The return of trade wars, nationalism and
belligerent military postures provide clues to the increasing weakness
of state administration: the declining ability of governments to
function as the political form of the class relation, or even as the
"committee for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie as a
whole" as Marx put it. In the short term, industrial policy will have to
overcome intractable inflation and other barriers to investment. The
high interest rates being maintained by central banks threaten another
debt crisis that will devastate low-income countries. They also deter
the borrowing necessary for investment in plant and equipment that
industrial policy is ostensibly intended to promote. Other options to
promote manufacturing, like the much-discussed tariffs, threaten to
exacerbate inflation in the prices of basic goods. The first two months
of the second Trump administration have demonstrated this double bind, a
clear representation of the era. The state can do little more than
dispense violence to manage the decline. Halcyon days indeed. \

Chaos and revanchism seem the order of the day. We are living in the
long shadow of defeat, the undertow of the long 2020. What the coming
cycles of struggle will bring is unclear. We wish we could promise that
the death of liberalism will become the real death of politics: an end
to the separation between the political and economic spheres. Rosa
Luxemburg articulated most clearly that the unity of the two finds
antagonistic expression in a revolutionary crisis, when the antinomy
between the struggle *within* and the struggle *against* becomes
suspended in the emergence of a communist program.[^4] While some kind
of a collapse is certainly underway, it has not been accompanied by the
widespread development of organizational, strategic, or tactical forms
that present such a resolution. Instead, we are left with a balance of
forces, always contending and shifting. \
\
Revolution is not an organizational riddle, but an ecosystemic problem.
Many projects make their burnt offerings to the communist prospect. Some
offer past ideologies and organizational forms as catch-all solutions to
the present: unions, autonomism, political parties, republicanism,
guerrilla cells, etc.[^5] Others relish in atomization as something to
be valorized, groupuscules and puritan cults of all sorts, each vying
for the mantle of radical idealism. While the past is certainly
foreclosed, the fog has not yet burned off to reveal tomorrow's
horizons. The flickering spasms of the weary leviathan saturate all
perspective. It's difficult to discern any direction in the twilight.
All that's available now is knowledge of the ecology, the conditions of
all future activity. Uncertainty is given, inquiry is necessary.
*Heatwave* is our humble offering to this ecosystem. \

alt="", caption="While the past is certainly foreclosed, the fog has not yet burned off to reveal tomorrow's horizons", extended_width_pct=-1) }} \
*Heatwave* begins with the gambit that communism remains a distinct
possibility, even if its contours are formless and its prospects bleak.
The frequency and repetition of today's major conflicts are modulations
of a cadence that began in 2005, when social irruptions began to spread
from the French *banlieues*, the *Zócalo* of Oaxaca, and the *Suea
Daeng* (Red Shirts) of Thailand to the riots of Exarcheia, the
occupation of Tahir Square, and the movement of *indignados.* The
movement of squares coalesced from 2011 to 2013, when the financial
crisis was translated by state administrators into public austerity and
debt in high- and low-income countries alike, initiating a cycle of
escalating antagonism against particular state institutions that set the
terms of social reproduction &mdash; the police, transportation authorities,
revenue agencies, energy departments. Conflicts over survival unfolded
in the spheres of circulation and reproduction. The 2018-2022 wave of
this long cycle proved particularly incendiary in this regard. To some,
the radiance of the flames suggested a guiding light to exit the stage
entirely, so when the fires were extinguished, despair set in. In those
moments when we glimpse the far horizon, its distant glow can trick us
into thinking we have entered a moment of rupture.[^6] \
\
It is a bitter pill to swallow, but we have not even come close.
Instead, what we glimpse is the assurance of the inevitable blazes to
come, the certainty of struggle, if nothing else. Cycles of struggle
have the habit of reshuffling the deck, suspending time and space and
providing practical truth to the communist hypothesis: the real death of
capital is not a given, but a matter of force. If one lesson has
percolated through the cracks and fissures of these moments, it is that
every limit is also a condition of possibility. Reading the
signposts &mdash; the failures, limitations, partial victories, tragedies &mdash; is
our only guide to the geography of conflict. The communist hypothesis
cannot be validated in advance of practice, but must instead be
constructed *in situ,* when the partisan contours begin to take shape
and choices must be made. That is, the lessons of the past can be
verified only in the revolutionary shattering of the world. What lessons
can we suppose today then? How are they to be derived and disseminated?
Our answer is insufficient, but necessary. Correspondence is a form
partisan inquiry and preparation elemental to our turbulent, but
decidedly non-revolutionary times. \

*Heatwave* is a multi-media project dedicated to sharing experiences and
strategizing together in our efforts to break free from the infernal
prison of capital. As the world burns and the political horizon grows
increasingly grim, we seek to connect comrades around the
globe and contribute to building something powerful enough to incinerate
that prison. From its ashes, a vision emerges: a world based on
the classic principle "from each according to their ability, to each
according to their need"---a dignified life on a thriving planet. \
\
Most of our current members are based in the U.S., but we aim to become
an international publication that examines struggles globally. In 2025,
we're launching our website, a quarterly print magazine, a video
channel, and social media. The website will provide previews of each new
issue of the magazine, information about ordering print copies, free
digital versions of back issues, and printable zines for longer texts.
The videos will provide alternative presentations of written
material. Our content will cover a range of topics and genres, including
reports on recent events, theoretical reflections and analysis,
interviews with comrades involved in inspiring projects, reviews of
books and films, original artwork, and literature. \
\
While there is no shortage of left media, most English-language
publications offer only partial critiques and tepid
reformism, or regurgitate debates among 20th-century sects whose
material foundations disappeared decades ago. We seek to provide more
rigor and depth than the average radical blog or podcast, but to avoid
the turgid style of traditional communist polemics and academic
journals. Politically, we aim to balance inclusivity with coherence by
publishing pieces from a broad spectrum of contributors based all over
the world, alongside editorial prefaces providing our own perspective.\
\
The name "Heatwave" echoes that of an old Situationist
magazine ("Britain's most incandescent
journal" of 1966), but with added urgency in an era where every summer
is the hottest on record. While the statistical certainty of catastrophe
is inescapable, "revolt" names many species of conflagration, including
that peculiar variety we call communism. We must sift through the ashes
to find it.

[^5]: Here want to emphasize two problems: nostalgia for past ideologies
    and organizational forms that may be inappropriate or impossible to
    revive *en masse* under current conditions, and the tendency to
    fetishize particular forms to the exclusion of others---as opposed
    to fostering a diverse ecosystem of forms that could facilitate the
    worldwide unleashing of communist measures (centered on
    expropriation) necessary to undermine capitalism and its corollaries
    (the state, gender, race, species). On this latter point, Neel's
    observations in "[The Knife at Your
    Throat](https://brooklynrail.org/2022/10/field-notes/The-Knife-At-Your-Throat/)"
    (*Brooklyn Rail*, October 2022) are instructive: "On their own, both
    illegality and the various forms of self-consciously political
    organizing---ranging from 'autonomous' activities such as mutual aid
    to the institutional projects of formal trade unionism or policy
    advocacy---tend to remain segregated from one another and from the
    population at large, with each form romanticized by some political
    faction within the broad but shallow 'Left.' ... If we take a more
    expansive view... the potential to build communist power is just as
    visible in the increasing popular interest in unionization as in the
    semi-improvised, semi-organized looting networks that developed
    through the George Floyd uprising.... It only grows into something
    more when the walls dividing the various channels of subsistence are
    broken down."
