Heatwave is a multi-media project dedicated to sharing experiences and strategizing together about our efforts to break free from the infernal prison of capital. As the world burns and the political horizon grows increasingly grim, we seek to connect comrades around the globe and contribute to building something powerful enough to incinerate that prison. From its ashes, a vision emerges: a world based on the classic principle _from each according to their ability, to each according to their need_ - a dignified life on a thriving planet.

As of Heatwave’s founding in late 2024, most of our members are based in the US, but we aim to become an international publication that examines struggles globally. In 2025, we will launch our website and a quarterly print magazine, envisioning a media ecosystem that also includes video and social media. The website will provide previews of each new issue of the magazine, information about purchasing print copies, free digital versions of back issues and printable zines for longer texts. The videos will provide alternative presentations of written material. Our content will cover a range of topics and genres, including reports on recent events, theoretical reflections and analysis, interviews with comrades involved in inspiring projects, reviews of books and films, original artwork, and literature.

While there is no shortage of left media, most English-language publications offer only partial critiques and tepid reformism, or regurgitate debates among 20th-century sects whose material foundations disappeared decades ago. We seek to provide more rigor and depth than the average radical blog or podcast, but to avoid the turgid style of traditional communist polemics and academic journals. Politically, we aim to balance inclusivity with coherence: We'll publish pieces by a broad spectrum of contributors from around the world, attaching editorial prefaces to provide our own perspective.

*Our name “Heatwave” echoes that of an old Situationist magazine (“Britain’s most incandescent journal" of 1966), but with added urgency in an era where every summer is the hottest on record.*
