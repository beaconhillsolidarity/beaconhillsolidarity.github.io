Beacon Hill Solidarity is a grassroots neighborhood union dedicated to bringing neighbors from all walks of life together in solidarity with each other.  Together, we want to build a community ecology rooted in cooperation, self-governance, and liberation for all.

Join us as we work to connect those in need with those who can offer support, find solutions to our common grievances, and *unify us into something greater than the sum of our parts.*
