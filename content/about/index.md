Beacon Hill Solidarity is a grassroots neighborhood union dedicated to building a community in commonâ€”a living network that brings neighbors from all walks of life together to collectively work towards a solidaristic, autonomous, and internationalist horizon.  Together, we are building the foundation for collective organization rooted in mutual aid, resiliancy, self-governance, and liberation for all. Join us as we work to make  a community that connects those in need with those who can offer support, solves our problems, participates in the decisions that impact our lives, and *joins us into something greater than the sum of our parts*
