Beacon Hill Solidarity is a grassroots neighborhood union dedicated to bringing neighbors from all walks of life together in solidarity with each other.  Together, we want to build a community ecology rooted in cooperation, self-governance, and liberation for all. 
<br />
<br />
Join us as we work to connect those in need with those who can offer support, find solutions to our common grievances, and *join us into something greater than the sum of our parts.*
<br />
<br />
> *In the current vacuum of human connection, where so many people are left isolated, disempowered, and
> fearful of the future, we have a unique opportunity not to just to repair the social fabric,
> but to reweave it, reaffirming the very notion of community as a revolutionary concept â€“ a living culture of solidarity and self-governance that defies all forms of domination, oppression and exploitation.*
