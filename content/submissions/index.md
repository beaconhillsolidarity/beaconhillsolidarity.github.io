We encourage original submissions in a variety of forms, including essays, political theory, reviews, visual media, and short fiction. Submissions need not conform strictly to a particular style. However, below are some parameters to consider that may aid in development. \
\
**Essays:** We are interested in critical analysis of the present, theoretically oriented by materialist inquiry. We are not interested in declarative missives or self-indulgent manifestos that trade scrutiny for polemics. We will also pass on "101 pieces" (e.g., introduction to Marxism, introduction to anarchism). There are many reputable outlets with which to publish these kinds of primers. Other than these constraints, the essay format is very flexible. Essays can be long-form or short-form, but we are interested in pieces in the range of 1,000 to 4,000 words.\
\
**Reports & Inquiry:** Political theory crystallizes from the practical experiences and struggles of daily life. We appreciate the form of the workers' inquiry as a model for researching and reporting on the technical and political conditions that shape class conflict, but we seek to extend that method to investigate social antagonisms and the formation of political subjectivities more generally. To that end, we solicit reports, including but not limited to reports from actions, protests, shitty jobs, or interactions with the state. Pieces should range from 1,000 to 4,000 words. Longer works have the option to be serialized. \
\
**Interviews:** Interview transcripts should be 1,000 to 4,000 words. \
\
**Reviews:** Reviews of media and cultural artifacts (books, film, music, art) should be 1,000 to 2,000 words. \
\
**Fiction:** We accept works of short fiction, up to 2,000 words. Longer works have the option to be serialized. \
\
**Visual media:** We include here art, political cartoons, infographics, photography, but are open to other submission inquiries. \
\
This list is of course not exhaustive. We are receptive to other proposals for submissions. Please send all pitches to [heatwavemag@proton.me](heatwavemag@proton.me). \
\
We encourage contributors to submit work that has been carefully drafted and thoroughly revised before final submission. Pieces that require less editorial handling will have a higher likelihood of being accepted. Heatwave is an all-volunteer project.
